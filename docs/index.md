## About [Demos123.net](http://demos123.net)

* This website is for **my own private practice and learning** in multiple products and Services.
* Feel free to take some ideas and learnings <-- **at your own risk!**
* And remember: **"practice makes perfect"**
> *"regular exercise of an activity or skill is the way to become proficient in it"*

* I am going to use mostly [AWS Products and Services](https://aws.amazon.com) and I will link in this page some demos for my own reference and practice.

* I hope this website will bright even more awareness of the "power of the cloud" and how impressive it can be!  Remember, speed of innovations is a key term for success (or failure), so start using the cloud now!

* **Disclaimer, use the cloud at your own risk ;)**


All the best,
