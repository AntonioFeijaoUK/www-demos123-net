## About [Demos123.net](http://demos123.net)

* This website is for **my own private practice and learning** in multiple products and Services.
* Feel free to take some ideas and learnings <-- **at your own risk!**
* And remember: **"practice makes perfect"**
> *"regular exercise of an activity or skill is the way to become proficient in it"*

* I am going to use mostly [AWS Products and Services](https://aws.amazon.com) and I will link in this page some demos for my own reference and practice.

* I hope this website will bright even more awareness of the "power of the cloud" and how impressive it can be!  Remember, speed of innovations is a key term for success (or failure), so start using the cloud now!

* **Disclaimer, use the cloud at your own risk ;)**


All the best,

## DEMO-1 - Static website on S3 bucket

* //TODO -- needs update
* [ ] Move file into the S3 bucksc
* [ ] change A and DNS records


```shell

This website, demos123.net <--- currently moved to github (this page)
This website itself, is a S3 bucket with static website option enabled

I am also using (to practice website front-end skills) the Bootstrap to make this page looking nicer.

The DNS record for this domain and website is also managed by Amazon Route 53
