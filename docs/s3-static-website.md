# Static website on S3 bucket
## AWS Services: S3

* //TODO -- needs update
* [ ] Move file into the S3 bucksc
* [ ] change A and DNS records


```shell

This website, demos123.net <--- currently moved to github (this page)
This website itself, is a S3 bucket with static website option enabled

I am also using (to practice website front-end skills) the Bootstrap to make this page looking nicer.

The DNS record for this domain and website is also managed by Amazon Route 53
