## Using AWS Services

* VPC - Virtual Private Computer

* NGW - NAT Gateway

* IGW - Internet Gateway

* EC2 - Amazon Linux

* ELB - Elastic Load Balancer

* ASG - Auto-Scalling, with cpu-usage-scale-IN and cpu-usage-scale-OUT simples-policies

* SNS - Simple Notification Services - sends email when a new machines was added by ASG (cpu-usage-scale-IN and cpu-usage-scale-OUT simples-policies)

---

## Link

* ELB Ireland's region - [http://vpc-96-111-autoscalling.demos123.net/](http://vpc-96-111-autoscalling.demos123.net/)
  - Note, is possible to use more than one ELB, and then routing to the multiple ELBs is done on *Route53*

##  Services Usage details

* Auto-Scalling
  - for scale-in or scale-out based of the workload
  - works with ELB to add or remote EC2 instances (depends on policies and machine status)
  - using Health check from ELB
  
 * Elastic Load Balancer
   - High Availability and Redundancy web-applicatoin across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
   - Using Public-ELB, routes (balances) the http traffic to the various EC2s
  
* Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)
  - Using the latest Amazon-Linux machine
  - running basic script on load (**user-data init script**) to download and execute a script from Github,
  (one day will learn to do it from AWS Codedeploy)
  - Script will install a Apache (or ngix) (**httpd**) and loads a basic webpage with **metadata** from the EC2
  - metadata like: machine-id, zone...
    
* VPC routing tables and subnets
  - multi-AZs 
  - multi-subnets (Public and Private)
  - VPC IP range 192.168.96.0/20
    - 192.168.101.0/24 - AZ-a-pub
    - 192.168.102.0/24 - AZ-b-pub
    - 192.168.103.0/24 - AZ-c-pub
    
    - 192.168.104.0/24 - AZ-a-priv
